/* 
This script is to help create a simple dimentional data model on Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations tables enabled via Fabric link 
Script creates following views that are intended to be used in the final Symantic data model and Power BI report.

1.[dbo].[customers]
2.[dbo].[legalentity]
3.[dbo].[products]
5.[dbo].[vendors]
6.[dbo].[salesorderdetails]

Two additonal views and function are created by script as generic template and used in the views above   
[dbo].[defaultfinancialdimension_view]
[dbo].[dirpartyprimary_view]
Table-Valued Functions: [dbo].[GetEnumTranslations]


Pre-requisites: You must have a Fabrik link/Synapse link setup with D365FO environment 
Following tables are enabled 
1. dirpartytable
2. companyinfo
3. logisticspostaladdress
4. logisticselectronicaddress
5. dimensionattributevaluesetitem
6. dimensionattributevalue
7. dimensionattribute
8. custtable

/* One of the important reporting task when dealing with reporting is BI to decode the concept of the FnO is Enums.
The primary purpose of using an enum is to define collections of constants that are logically related to each other. 
Example of enum could be SalesStatus = (1-OpenOrder,2-Delivered,3-Invoiced,4-Canceled etc)
In the backend system enums are stored in the integer value, however in the front end they are represent as more meaningfull text value 
In Fabric link and Synapse link tables stores in integer representation of the enum. 
You can fined the mapping enum to string in the GlobalOptionsetMetadata table. 

This generic implementation of a table value function can return all the enum translation for a given table that can be further 
used to get translalted string value as column value for given table.

Code is 

A simple example use of this 

select 
salesline.salesstatus,
JSON_VALUE(enum.enumtranslation, CONCAT('$.salesstatus."', salesline.salesstatus,'"'))  as [Order Status]
from salesline salesline
cross apply GetEnumTranslations('salesline', '1033') as enum
group by salesline.salesstatus, enum.enumtranslation
salesstatus	Order Status
1	Open order
2	Delivered
3	Invoiced
4	Canceled
