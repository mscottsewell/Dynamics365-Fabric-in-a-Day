/* 
This script is to help create a simple dimentional data model similar to Dynamics 365 schema on MicrosoftDynamics AX Data copied to Fabric Lakehouse 
Script creates following views that are intended to be used in the final Symantic data model and Power BI report.

1.[dbo].[customers]
2.[dbo].[legalentity]
3.[dbo].[products]
4.[dbo].[legalentity] 
5.[dbo].[vendors]
6.[dbo].[salesorderdetails]

Two additonal views and function are created by script as generic template and used in the views above   
[dbo].[defaultfinancialdimension_view]
[dbo].[dirpartyprimary_view]


Pre-requisites: You must have a AX 2012 data copied to Microsoft OneLake
Following tables are enabled 
1. dirpartytable
3. logisticspostaladdress
4. logisticselectronicaddress
5. dimensionattributevaluesetitem
6. dimensionattributevalue
7. dimensionattribute
8. custtable
9. custgroup

"Global address book" stores party records and physical address and electronic address in central tables.  
 Following view provides common and simple representation of the party to include the key fields 
 partyid, name, primary address, primary phone number and email
